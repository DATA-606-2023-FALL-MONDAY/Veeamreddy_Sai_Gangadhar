## 2. Background

**What is the Project about?**

This project is all about using data to help retail businesses make better decisions. The primary objective of this project is to offer a comprehensive understanding of the retail landscape, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions that enhance their operations, boost profitability, and ultimately enrich the customer experience. By doing this, we can discover important trends and patterns that can help stores improve their operations, make more money, and give customers a better shopping experience. In the end, the goal is to give retailers the tools they need to succeed in a competitive market by using data in smart ways. 

**Why does it matter?**

It matters because it can make stores more successful and customers happier. When stores use data to make decisions, they can sell things better and not waste money on stuff people don't want. This helps stores stay in business and keep prices reasonable. It also means shoppers can find what they need and maybe even get good deals. So, using data is like a win-win for stores and customersâ€”it helps everyone.

**What are your research questions?**

- **Sales Prediction:**
Can we use the information about store location, temperature, fuel prices, and special holiday weeks to predict how much a store will sell in a given week? This could help stores plan better.

- **Markdown Impact Analysis:**
Do discounts and promotional markdowns have a big effect on sales? We can investigate if offering discounts during certain weeks leads to increased sales.

- **Store Clustering:**
Can we group similar stores together based on their sales history and the features like location and economic conditions? This might help stores understand their competition and market better.

- **Holiday Sales Assessment:**
Does having a special holiday week significantly change sales patterns? We can examine if stores should prepare differently for these weeks in terms of stocking and staffing.

## 3. Data 

**Describe the datasets you are using to answer your research questions:**
The data is about a retail business that occurred in 45 different stores from 2010 to 2013. There are three separate CSV files in the dataset, each containing information about sales, store features, and store details. When we combine these datasets by matching shared columns, we create a final dataset. This final dataset allows us to analyze sales in relation to factors like store location, holidays, and store size. 

**Data sources:**
The data set is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset?select=stores+data-set.csv


### Features dataset
